Recently, I developed a simple Clock generator that was designed to create clocks *(as seen above)*, that were able to be embedded virtually **anywhere**

This started off as a small learning project, and lead me to create **[this](https://jamesinaxx.github.io/Clocks/)** which you can check out and use in your own site if you please
